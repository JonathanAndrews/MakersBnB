###Description
The aim of the task was to create a clone of the website AirBnB from scratch within a group. we were offered the chance to use either the language Ruby or JavaScript based on how comfortable we were with them.

###Technologies Used
As a team, we chose to use the language JavaScript, which involved using new technologies such as:

**Front End:**
EJS
Skeleton

**Back End:**
Node
Express
MongoDB
Mongoose

**Behaviour Driven Development:**
Zombie
Jasmine

##Instructions
- Clone this repo to your computer:

`git clone https://github.com/JonathanAndrews/MakersBnB.git`

- Install [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/v2/community) to your computer. Use this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX15WbKidXY) if your encounter any issues.

- Install Node and check for updates

`brew install node`

- Install dependencies

`npm install`

- Set up test database

`node testDatabaseSetup.js`

- run Mongod server in your terminal

`mongod`

- In a separate terminal run application server

`node index.js`

- Go to localhost:3000 in your web browser

###User Stories
At the beginning of the week, we were given a list of [headline specifications](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/makersbnb/specification_and_mockups.md), which we used to create these user stories:

At the start, the ones with the green ticks were ones we felt were key towards achieving our minimum viable product.

##What We Expected/Initial Goals

- To improve our collaborative learning skills
- To establish a good developer workflow
- Building a functional web page that allows a User Sign Up or log back in
- Allows a User to add a space to the website
- Allows a User to book a space from listed spaces on the website
- Allowing a booking to be approved and confirmed

##What We Achieved
- Understanding MongoDB and Mongoose
- Using these tools to store and retrieve information from the database
- Learning to test asynchronous code
- Setting up node JS and NPM
- Setting up an Express app
- Creating mongoose Schemas
- Feature driven development of the website
- Allowing Users to Sign Up or Log in to our framework
- Users are able to list a space with their ID saved to that space
- Have a skeletal structure which allows a user to book a date in a space

I think this week has proven very productive. Working in a group provides a new set of challenges along with the ones that the weekly challenge had, so getting to grips with it at first
