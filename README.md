### Description
The aim of the task was to create a clone of the website AirBnB from scratch within a group. we were offered the chance to use either the language Ruby or JavaScript based on how comfortable we were with them.

### Technologies Used
As a team, we chose to use the language JavaScript, which involved using new technologies such as:

**Front End:**
EJS
Skeleton

**Back End:**
Node
Express
MongoDB
Mongoose

**Behaviour Driven Development:**
Zombie
Jasmine

## Instructions
- Clone this repo to your computer:

`git clone https://github.com/JonathanAndrews/MakersBnB.git`

- Install [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/v2/community) to your computer. Use this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX15WbKidXY) if you encounter any issues.

- Install Node and check for updates

`brew install node`

- Install dependencies

`npm install`

- Set up test database

`node testDatabaseSetup.js`

- run Mongod server in your terminal

`mongod`

- In a separate terminal run application server

`node index.js`

- Go to localhost:3000 in your web browser

###User Stories
At the beginning of the week, we were given a list of [headline specifications](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/makersbnb/specification_and_mockups.md), which we used to create these user stories:
![User Stories](domain-models/user-stories.png)

At the start, the ones with the green ticks were ones we felt were key towards achieving our minimum viable product.

## What We Expected/Initial Goals

- To improve our collaborative learning skills
- To establish a good developer workflow
- Building a functional web page that allows a User Sign Up or log back in
- Allows a User to add a space to the website
- Allows a User to book a space from listed spaces on the website
- Allowing a booking to be approved and confirmed

## What We Achieved
- Understanding MongoDB and Mongoose
- Using these tools to store and retrieve information from the database
- Learning to test asynchronous code
- Setting up node JS and NPM
- Setting up an Express app
- Creating mongoose Schemas
- Feature driven development of the website
- Allowing Users to Sign Up or Log in to our framework
- Users are able to list a space with their ID saved to that space
- Have a skeletal structure which allows a user to book a date in a space


## Lessons from each day

1. Don’t code until you understand, _don’t panic_.

2. Understand the stack.

3. Work front to back, “feature —> Unit —> refactor“

4. Focus on process, not the project.

5. __Have fun__.


## What We Would Want to Improve

## How You Feel It Went

**Alex:**

It was genuinely a success. The greatest thing about the week was how well we worked together as a team and I truly believe we accomplished our primary goal which was to grow collaboratively. This was our driving force when working on this project. We developed a pretty good MVP and although haven't completed all our user stories, we were satisfied with the work we've created and I'm personally proud of how well we did.

My accomplishments include being a good facilitator in our discussions, learning an entirely new tech stack from scratch, and working from the perspective of the process.

**Jonathan:**

There were two main challenges this week.

The first was understanding and using an unfamiliar tech stack. Having never used a NoSQL database before, we spent the first two days getting to grips with Mongo, our database, and Mongoose, an ORM. This was very valuable and made the later part of the week much smoother.

The second challenge was coding as a team. This meant we needed to be very specific about what each pair was working on and to communicate regularly, something we got better at over the week.

**Ayo:**

I think this week has proven very productive. Working in a group provides a new set of challenges along with the ones that the weekly challenge had, but I felt that we did very well to work as a group and help each other out in achieving our goals and tasks set by ourselves.

Learning the new tech stack and being able to understand it at first proved challenging, but we took time to make sure that everyone did research on it and felt comfortable with it before using. Overall very happy with how the week went and felt we got stronger as a group with each day that went by.
